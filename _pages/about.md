I’m a mexican guy mid-twenties pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I have a Master in Electrical Engineering from UNAM and a background in Mechatronics Engineering. I’m also an amateur photographer. My research mostly focus in polarimetry and optics instrumentation.
