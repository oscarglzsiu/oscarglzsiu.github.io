I’m a mexican guy mid-twenties pursuing a Master in Electrical Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). I have a background in Mechatronics Engineering and I’m an amateur photographer. My research mostly focus in polarimetry and optics instrumentation. You can contact me at oscargsiu(AT)gmail.com
